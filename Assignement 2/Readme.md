# Assignment 2
I have applied SKLearn MLPClassifer/Regressor and Keras techniques for the data used in Assignment 01.

Defined and trained an MLP and Keras Sequential model that predicts the output target variable. Experimented with the settings discussed/demonstrated in to identify the best-performing predictive model.
