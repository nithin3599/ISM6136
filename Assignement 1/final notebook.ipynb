    "After training and splitting the data in the previous notebook we have directly imported and loaded the data sets of train and test, now that we have loaded the data we can directly perfomr the metric analysis. For this I have taken accuracy as my metrics because as per my data set is considered it is well balanced and trained and after the changes made to 0 and 1 which says that in the target varibale, if it says the value is 0 then the death is not occured and if it says 1 death is occured.\n",
    "\n",
    "1)To predict the death occured precisely considering the other attributes I have choosen accuracy as my scoring metric. As a classification problem I have first made inclinatio to do the logistic regression using random search and grid search for which I have closely got to 84% in both the cases, based on the problem that we are solving I am satisfied that the data is balanced and have acheived good accuracy for logistic regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2)Decision tree: For decision tree default we have achieved an accuracy score of 100 percent which is good thing to consider, we understand the training data has leant to overfit the data and also it has leanrt the noise and peculiarities of the training data set. But one thought that strikes here is that the training data set has learnt good enough that is giving us better output but we should also use cross validation techniques than can genralise well on the new data obtained from the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3)IN SVM using random search and grid search the model is able to give the accuracy if 84 percent in both the cases that means the depth of the data that this model is covering to get 84 percent is a good, as explained above the training data set have learned to overcome the noise and and in this case it can be considered as a good model for the quality of the data that we have after training the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the accuracy acheived is nearly 84 percent in all the cases and we can conclude that the data is trained well and the quality of the data is good, but what I still feel is that we can tune the hyper parameters and can acheive good results above 84 percent, there is also decent amount of chance that the model may not be able to generalize to new data that is significantly different from the training data. To evaluate all this we should tune the hyperparametrs and also check thorougly with the overfitting of the data.a"
