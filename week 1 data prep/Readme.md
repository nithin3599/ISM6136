# week 1

we have recalled that we have identified five categorical variables. We encoded two of these variables (neighborhood_cleansed and property_type) using dummy variable encoding and the remaining three using label encoding (room_type, bed_type, and cancellation_policy). 

For this exercise, I find myself in a situation where my manager disagrees with my choice of encoding and wants the variables that I encoded using dummy variable encoding to use one-hot-encoding instead. He also wants one of the three variables (the cancellation_policy variable) you label encoded to be one-hot-encoded.
